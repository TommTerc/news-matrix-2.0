Tommys News Aggregator project

Im using bolt.new for initial infrastructure News aggregator that compares mainstream news media with alternative news media with an interactive matrix (the movie) theme. I drew inspiration for user interface from twitter reddit and drudge report. Im planning a timeline interactive function following the news story.
